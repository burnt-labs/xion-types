 * The revision of a package can be thought of as the minor version of a
 * package which has additional backwards compatible definitions that weren't
 * present in a previous version.
 *
 * A package should indicate its revision with a source code comment
 * above the package declaration in one of its files containing the
 * text "Revision N" where N is an integer revision. All packages start
 * at revision 0 the first time they are released in a module.
 *
 * When a new version of a module is released and items are added to existing
 * .proto files, these definitions should contain comments of the form
 * "Since: Revision N" where N is an integer revision.
 *
 * When the module runtime starts up, it will check the pinned proto
 * image and panic if there are runtime protobuf definitions that are not
 * in the pinned descriptor which do not have
 * a "Since Revision N" comment or have a "Since Revision N" comment where
 * N is <= to the revision specified here. This indicates that the protobuf
 * files have been updated, but the pinned file descriptor hasn't.
 *
 * If there are items in the pinned file descriptor with a revision
 * greater than the value indicated here, this will also cause a panic
 * as it may mean that the pinned descriptor for a legacy module has been
 * improperly updated or that there is some other versioning discrepancy.
 * Runtime protobuf definitions will also be checked for compatibility
 * with pinned file descriptors to make sure there are no incompatible changes.
 *
 * This behavior ensures that:
 * * pinned proto images are up-to-date
 * * protobuf files are carefully annotated with revision comments which
 *   are important good client UX
 * * protobuf files are changed in backwards and forwards compatible ways
