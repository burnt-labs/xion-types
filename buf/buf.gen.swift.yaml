  # The issue is Swift's filename uniqueness constraint. 
  # Swift can't compile two files named module.pb.swift in the same target, even if they're in different subdirectories.
  # Two protobuf files are generating the same Swift filename:
  # cosmos/app/runtime/v1alpha1/module.proto → module.pb.swift
  # cosmos/app/v1alpha1/module.proto → module.pb.swift
  # Both end up in XionTypesCosmosPart00 target, causing the collision.
  # Fix: Use path-based naming for Swift protobuf generation.
